Revolutionizing Real Estate with Blockchain

In the world of finance, Satoshi and Billy revolutionized money, while Vitalik and friends created a decentralized internet. The next big challenge lies in real estate, the largest asset class globally. Outdated systems have long plagued the industry, causing unnecessary hardships for people, particularly in less free societies where citizens don't have the resources to hire middlemen to enforce their private property rights or sell their real estate for them. A smart contract has the potential to be legally enforceable. In Arizona, where I broker real estate, they are. That's where this dApp will rollout first.

Blockchain technology offers a solution by providing a transparent, secure, and efficient way to trade real estate. By leveraging smart contracts, NFT deeds, digital identity verifiers, decentralized file storage, and AI, we can create an all-in-one, peer-to-peer (P2P) real estate platform for both sellers and buyers. Buyers are able to send offers to Sellers Peer to Peer. Buyers pay the "write" eth gas, and sellers read so no gas. After acceptance, a "pay earnest deposit to escrow" function, all of which encourage only serious buyers.

This dApp will be free for users, open-source and decentralized. It will work from a map and plug legal contracts for the regions in from there, using a hash identifier so on chain data is minimized to only eSign pages & Deed NFT. Local third-party intermediaries such as realtors, lenders, and title companies pay a fee for the lead generation from the platform if the user requests their assistance. By using a proxy contract for upgradability, implementing a governance mechanism, and incorporating AI with human review, contracts used can adapt to changing local legal requirements over time. 

Property records will be stored on-chain from a lot line map base layer. Deeds are incentivezed to become tokenized (then becomes highlighted on map), offering a verifiable way to decentralize and govern private ownership rights. The goal is to replace outdated legacy systems of deed recordation, storage, and upkeep (typically done by county staff) with a more efficient, cost-effective, decentralized, and globally accessible solution. 

Transactions will be conducted using Dogecoin on the world's greatest decentralized exchange (coming soon), ensuring the lowest processing fees on earth. This platform will not only revolutionize the real estate industry but also contribute to a more decentralized and equitable global economy.
