Revolutionizing Real Estate with Blockchain

In the world of finance, Satoshi and Billy revolutionized money, while Vitalik and frens created a decentralized internet. The next big challenge lies in REAL ESTATE, THE WORLD'S LARGEST ASSET CLASS. 

Outdated systems have long plagued the industry, causing unnecessary hardships for people, particularly in less free societies where citizens don't have the resources to hire middlemen to enforce their private property rights or sell their real estate for them. Power hungry governments don't necessarily want great citizen property rights, and they are the keepers the deeds, which is a conflict of interest.  

The goal is for this DApp to replace legacy systems through incentivization (cheaper/faster/better) to mint the deeds. In Arizona, where I broker real estate, smart contracts are legally enforceable. That's where this DApp will test rollout. 

By leveraging smart contracts & NFT deeds on Dogechain network (wrapped Doge), using digital identity verifiers, decentralized file storage, e signatures, AI for contract (off chain) updates. All-in-one, P2P real estate platform. Buyers are able to send offers to Sellers within the dApp. Buyers pay the "write" eth gas, and sellers read, so no gas. After acceptance, a "pay earnest deposit to escrow" function, both of which encourage serious buyers only.

This dApp will be FREE FOR USERS, OPEN SOURCE, and DECENTRALIZED. It will work from a lot-line color-coded (NFT deed or not) map. It offers legal contracts for the regions and uses a hash identifier so on chain data is minimized to only eSigned contract pages & minted NFT upon recordation.

Local third-party intermediaries such as realtors, lenders, and title companies can pay a fee for the lead generation from the platform if the user requests their assistance. The DApp auto generates area vendors by: A. promoting registered users (vendors) first and B. pulling them off of the internet.

The platform will be built on Dogechain, based on Polygon Edge and using Solidity, with transactions conducted using Dogecoin for low fees and fast transactions. This will revolutionize the real estate industry and contribute to a more decentralized and equitable global economy, allowing people who cannot afford or do not want to use third-party intermediary services to transact freely.
